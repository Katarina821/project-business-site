# Business Site

Assignment: Create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion using Javascript.

## The problem

I had some difficulties with adding the transition effect to the accordion which i solved it by setting opacity and height values to 0 instead of using display:none. I also had some trouble with styling the sign-up form which i solved by doing the layout first and then styling one element at the time. If i would have had more time i would have styled the checkboxes and radibuttons aswell.
